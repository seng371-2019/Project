## What was discussed:
At the beginning of this sprint we had very little knowledge on what direction we were taking for Project 2. Therefore, the majority of this sprint was dedicated to planning out what was to be done surrounding Project 2. Our initial plan for Project 2 was described in Part 5 of Project 1. Itâ€™s scope was not achievable in the time given to us for Project 2 so we narrowed down the scope to what was described in the Project 2 Outline document.

In terms of Project 2 sprint planning not much was discussed and because of that not much was completed. We quickly discussed what our scope for Project 2 was going to be but no tasks were assigned.

## Tasks completed by members:
## Oliver Lewis
Discussed the Project 2 deliverables and expectations with Yvonne.

Took part in the discussion to scope out Project 2.

Followed up our project 2 scope with Yvonne to ensure that it was attainable.

## Eric May
Familiarized with STAC spec

Looked into implementation of Azure and Jenkins

Took part in the discussion to scope out Project 2

## Tyler Drover

## Reece Pretorius
Researched the STAC spec

Started researching how to navigate the STAC geoJSON layout and gather information from it.


## Jesse Browell
Researched STAC specification and previous ways it was implemented. 

Took part in the discussion to scope out Project 2.

Familiarized with and did research on tools used for the project.  

## Issues:
The first and most obvious problem we faced was scope management. While we liked the idea we proposed in project 1, a closer look at the problem domain made it clear that we had bitten off far more than we could chew.

A complete re-evaluation was needed, with an emphasis on achievability. While we have drastically reduced our scope during this sprint, we still face the challenge of venturing into unfamiliar territory. None of our group members have any prior experience with STAC or with cloud computing. This makes it difficult to plan accurately. Thus, going forward, we will place an emphasis on research and time management.

Completely redefining the project meant reconsidering the tools we had chosen. Some (eg: docker) were now unnecessary, and others (eg: Azure) appeared to have a steeper learning curve and less public support than other options. For these reasons, we decided to switch to using Google Cloud and Travis CI, which we feel we can integrate more quickly than our previous choices.
