# Project 2 Outline
## Part 1: Project Breakdown
For this project our group is going to build a proof of concept for a STAC Spec search engine. We want to show how someone might go about searching through a large dataset that conforms to the STAC specification. For the implimentation we are utilizing a varriety of tools (Part 6) in the hopes of convincing the developers building the Earth Observation Platform that they need to use the right tools. We have broken down the project into the following tasks:

## Part 2: Approach
TODO: Here we can talk about how we are attempting to tackle this project. This could reference the above section.

The approach our group will be taking for this project is is to break it down into smaller millestones consisting of research, design, development, and testing tasks. Many of the the inital research and design that must be down will require a whole team effort so that everone is on the same page, however, once the inital research phaze is over then we can work on individual tasks. For the coding and testing tasks, each task can be assigned to one or two group members to speed up the development time. Once the final testing has been completed, then we will get together once more as a group and finish the final report which is due. The timeline which we will follow is outlined below. 

Since, for many of the technologies we have limited knowladge of how they work and are implimedted, communication will be critical throughout the project. In order to ensure that communication is maintained throughout, our group will rely heavily on Slack.

## Part 4: Timeline
TODO: This timeline should be based upon the project breakdown. I've already made a rough timeline in the RACI chart I submitted for this past weeks lab. 

For this project, we have broken down the parts into 5 different milestones over the course of the month. The first milestone is mostly planning and gaining familiarity with the tools in our project. Because the tools we are using are new to our team members, we have scheduled time to become familiar with these tools and plan exactly how they are used. Azure, Jenkins and Puppet are all fairly complicated tools and having an idea of how they will be implemented into our project will make development much more smooth. During this time period we will also acquire STAC compliant data to use in our project. We currently plan to have milestone 1 done by March 11th. 

For milestone two and three we will be building on the planning done in the first. In the second milestone, we plan to get the specifics of how the tools will be implemented. The exact requirements needed to use Azure in our project, an outline for the automation using GitHub, Puppet and Jenkins, and any configurations for our system will all be decided in this phase. Milestone three will have the team begin working with STAC compliant data. This is where we will create an outline on how to search through STAC spec and become more familiar with datasets used by researchers. Both milestones 2 and 3 will be finished by March 18th.

The fourth and fifth milestones are where we will implement our ideas and build the project. Milestone four is where we will begin creating the project. This phase is where we will develop modules for things such as the User Interface, the search function and the ability to store data in the cloud. In the fifth milestone, we will begin connecting these modules and make sure that they work together. This is also the milestone where we will do testing to catch any bugs that could exist. Milestone 4 is expected to be done on March 28th and Milestone 5 on March 30th.

 
## Part 5: Risks
TODO: here we can outline risks involved with scope, time management, incorrect tools, general lack of knowledge on the application of these tools, etc. 
 
## Part 6: Tools Used
Version Control: GitHub

Automation: Jenkins

Configuration Management: Puppet

Cloud Platform: Microsoft Azure

Communication: Slack
